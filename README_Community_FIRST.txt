Community FIRST: Food Insecurity Risk Score Tracker
===================================================

This toolkit helps schools, community centers, and resource teams identify and address food insecurity risks
in a non-invasive, accessible way using easy-to-obtain household data.

Included Tools:
---------------

1. Community_FIRST_Risk_Score.csv
   - Sample data input with pre-filled households and scoring logic.

2. community_first_app.py
   - Streamlit app for calculating scores and identifying food insecurity risk levels.

3. Community_FIRST_Flyer.pdf
   - Overview flyer explaining the tool's purpose, usage, and value for schools or centers.

How It Works:
-------------

- Each "Yes" response (e.g., SNAP use, housing instability) adds 15 points.
- Households receive a score from 0 to 100 and are categorized into:
    - Low (0–39)
    - Medium (40–69)
    - High (70–89)
    - Critical (90–100)

Use Cases:
----------

- Identify high-need families without accessing sensitive health data
- Integrate food insecurity screening into school intake or support planning
- Share data securely among partner orgs for coordinated outreach
